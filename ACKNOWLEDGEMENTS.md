A significant portion of the protocol knowledge in Alkahest is based on
research done by the developers of the
[tera-data](https://github.com/meishuu/tera-data) and
[Shinra Meter](https://github.com/neowutran/ShinraMeter) projects.

The encryption code is based on the defunct TERA emulator project; a license
was not specified for that code.
